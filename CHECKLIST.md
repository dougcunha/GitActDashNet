*   [ ] **FR-08:** Implement the filter buttons ("All", "Personal", "Organization").
*   [ ] **FR-09:** Implement the repository list sorting functionality.
*   [ ] **FR-07:** Implement persistence of repository selection in `localStorage` using `LocalStorageService` when checking/unchecking a checkbox.

*   [ ] **FR-11:** Create the `Components/Shared/RepositoryColumn.razor` component.
*   [ ] **FR-12:** Create the `Components/Shared/WorkflowCard.razor` component.
*   [ ] **FR-10:** In `Dashboard.razor`, for each selected repository, fetch the workflows and their latest runs using `GitHubService` and handle OperationResult responses.
*   [ ] **FR-11:** Display the selected repositories in a column layout using `RepositoryColumn`.
*   [ ] **FR-12:** Inside each column, display the `WorkflowCard` with name, status, and time of the last run.
*   [ ] **FR-12:** Implement colored visual indicators for run status (`success`, `failure`, etc.).
*   [ ] **FR-13:** Implement the link in `WorkflowCard` to open the workflow page on GitHub.
